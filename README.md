# DShield.py
DShield.py is a Python script that can parse Linux ipchains and iptables firewall logs as well as Snort syslog alerts into the DShield format and mail them (to DShield.org)

Comitted to github for archieving purposes. I might pick this one up one day, since the original authors seems to have abandonded it.

I changed some things to make it work on recent linux (see CHANGELOG) and bumped the version number to 4.0
