4.0 (27 may 2019) Thijs Eilander (eilander@myguard.nl)
    - Added date emailheader
    - Changed regexps to work with current iptables logfile
    - Fixed some other small things to make it work on Ubuntu 18.04
    * Changed mailport to port 587 (submission)

3.2 (7 June 2003)
    - The script would crash if it could not resolve the name of a protocol
      (i.e. socket.getprotobyname()). Unfortunately, this will always happen
      on a standard Linux distribution if ESP or AH packets are logged.
    * Full logging options for Netfilter are now dealt with properly (i.e.
      --log-tcp-sequence and friends).

3.1 (28 March 2003)
    - Misinterpreted "count" field in DShield report format fixed. As a
      result, the database format also needed to be changed.
    * Type for the flags field in the database improved. Between the last
      change and this one, there is a three byte savings per entry.
    - Fixed a traceback when GPG returns an error and an encrypted file
      doesn't exist
    * Small doc changes

    + Added support for Snort
    + Added minimal support for locales

    * Changed the log prefix to ignore for iptables to a config option
    - Long options from the command line were ignored
    - Fixed TCP flags parsing for iptables entries
    - Fixed a bug wherein the sequence number is reset if a line to be
      ignored comes between two identical lines
    - In report(), LF -> CRLF
    * Slightly better error checking when opening log file

    + Added support for SSL/TLS to mail server
    + Added support for authenticating to mail server
    + Added use of SIZE SMTP verb

    - Python 1.5.2 is supported again, but not for the new smtp options
    * General cleanups, formatting and improving

    * Other method to read the file (faster).
    * More manual way to handle the mail sending.
    * Send the report line for line to the SMTP server, not at
      once.    
    * Fixed/better parsing of TCP flags.
    + Function to read VAL from VAR=VAL fields.
    * Removed regexps where possible (speed!).

1.8.1 (Apr 2 2002)
    - Typo... grrrr.

1.8 (Apr 2 2002)
