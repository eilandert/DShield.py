  As of DShield.py 3.0, support for GPG is available for signing
and encrypting submissions to DShield.

  There have, however, been problems with the submissions, and the
authors are in contact with the DShield staff to resolve the
problems.  Specifically, even after submitting a public key to
DShield for the user's profile, signatures and encryption are not
recognized, and are simply rejected as extraneous lines. We have
reason to believe that GPG-signed or -encrypted submissions would
work for users who submitted a public key when first setting up
their account.

  If anyone has more information, or if someone can confirm or
deny anything related to this problem, please let us know at
arjones@users.sourceforge.net or eelcol@users.sourceforge.net.
